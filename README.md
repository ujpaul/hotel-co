# STRATEGY

## Initial assessment and Planning
* Understand the legacy system by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing  application to identify its features, shortcomings, and performance issues.
* Engaging with  business department and end-users to gather their requirements and feedback.
* Define project goals and set clear objectives for the new system

## Technology Stack Selection
* Choose a modern technology stack and select the most suitable for the new system requirements.
* Evaluate  integration with the existing backend systems, APIs, and databases.
## Design and User Experience
* Collaborate with UX/UI designers to create a user-friendly interface that aligns with the brand and meets user expectations.
* Create visual representations of the application to gather feedback and refine the design before development begins.
## Agile Development Methodology
* Use iterative development cycles with regular sprint reviews to ensure continuous improvement and flexibility in responding to changing requirements.
* Implement tools for code version control and automated deployment to streamline the development process.
## Development and Testing
* Write clean, well-documented, and reusable code components to ensure long-term maintainability
* Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to identify and resolve issues at an early stage.
## Accessibility and Cross-Browser Compatibility
* Make the application accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following best practices and using accessible UI components.
* Test across browsers and devices to validate the application's functionality and appearance on various browsers and screen sizes.
## Security and Compliance
* Implement security measures and security best practices to protect user data and prevent securtity vulnerabilities.
## Training and Documentation
* Create  comprehensive developer documentation and user guides to assist in onboarding, troubleshooting, and future maintenance.
* Provide training sessions for the development and support teams to ensure they understand the new system.
## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
* Involve business units and end-users in thorough testing and validation of the application to ensure it meets their expectations.
* Address and resolve any issues or feedback identified during the UAT phase.

## Deployment and Monitoring
* Deploy the new application in stages to minimize disruption and risks.
* Implement tools for real-time performance monitoring, error tracking, and user behavior analysis.
## Go-Live
* Plan and execute the go-live, including user communication and support during the transition.
* Addressing any unexpected issues that may arise during the initial deployment.
